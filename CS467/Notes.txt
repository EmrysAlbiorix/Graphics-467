Notes from class on ReTracing:

- Intersect a ray with all obj
- Find closest point
- Do Light Model
- Color pixel
- Go to next pixel ray

Reflection is doable
Refraction is doable

Final Project Idea (Maze with mirror to look behind)

For solving the 2d_Simple:
- Work backwards on the inverse of the shape

(x)   (a)      (c-a)
    =	  + t*
(y)   (b)      (d-b)

We want the smallest positive t value
-t is behind view, non-real t means doesn't intersect
